.SH NAME
ifreload \- reload network interface configuration
.SH SYNOPSIS
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
ifreload [\-h] (\-a|\-c) [\-v] [\-d] [\-f] [\-n] [\-s]
.UNINDENT

.SH DESCRIPTION
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
reloads network \fBinterfaces(5)\fP file \fB/etc/network/interfaces\fP
or config file defined in ifupdown2.conf file.
.sp
Runs \fBifdown\fP on interfaces that were removed from the file and
subsequently runs \fBifup\fP on all interfaces.
.sp
ifreload is non\-disruptive. It will fix running config to match what
is configured in the interfaces file without bringing the interface
down. There are some cases where on linux an interface config cannot
be applied unless the interface is brought down...eg: change of mac
address and a few bond attributes. For such attribute changes, it may
flap the interface only if the linux kernel requires it to.
.sp
When removing an interface (iface section) from the interfaces file
please make sure all its references are removed as well. Similarly
when renaming an interface, please make sure all references to the
interface are changed to the new name. Renaming an interface
in the interfaces file results in ifdown of the old and ifup
of the interface with the new name.
.sp
If you do not wish to execute \fBdown\fP on any interfaces, but only \fBup\fP on
interfaces that were already \fBup\fP, please see the \fB\-\-currently\-up\fP
option below.

.TP
.B  \-c\fP,\fB  \-\-currently\-up
Reload the configuration for all interfaces which
are currently up regardless of whether an interface
has "auto <interface>" configuration within the
/etc/network/interfaces file.
.TP
.BI \-X \ EXCLUDEPATS\fR,\fB \ \-\-exclude \ EXCLUDEPATS
Exclude interfaces from the list of interfaces to
operate on. Can be specified multiple times
If the excluded interface has dependent interfaces,
(e.g. a bridge or a bond with multiple enslaved interfaces)
then each dependent interface must be specified in order
to be excluded.
.TP
.B  \-s\fP,\fB  \-\-syntax\-check
Only run the interfaces file parser
