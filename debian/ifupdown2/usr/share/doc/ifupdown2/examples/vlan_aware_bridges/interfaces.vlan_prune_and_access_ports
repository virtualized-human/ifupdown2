# vlan-aware bridge access ports and pruned vlan example
#
# 'bridge' is a vlan aware bridge with all ports (swp1-52).
# native vlan is by default 1
#
# 'bridge-vids' attribute is used to declare vlans.
# 'bridge-pvid' attribute is used to specify native vlans if other than 1
# 'bridge-access' attribute is used to declare access port
#
# 

# The following is an access port to vlan 310, no trunking
auto swp1
iface swp1
      bridge-access 310
      mstpctl-portadminedge yes
      mstpctl-bpduguard yes

# The following is a truk port that is "pruned".
# native vlan is 1, but only .1q tags of 707, 712, 850 are
# sent and received
#
auto swp2
iface swp2
      bridge-vids 707 712 850
      mstpctl-portadminedge yes
      mstpctl-bpduguard yes
     
# The following port is the trunk uplink and inherits all vlans
# from 'bridge'
auto swp49
iface swp49
      mstpctl-portpathcost 10
      # Enable bridge assurance on uplink port using 'portnetwork' attribute
      mstpctl-portnetwork yes

# The following port is the trunk uplink and inherits all vlans
# from 'bridge'
auto swp50
iface swp50
      mstpctl-portpathcost 0
      # Enable bridge assurance on uplink port using 'portnetwork' attribute
      mstpctl-portnetwork yes

#
# ports swp3-swp48 are trunk ports which inherit vlans from the 'bridge'
# ie vlans 310,700,707,712,850,910
      
#
# the following is a vlan aware bridge with ports swp1-swp52
# It has stp on
#
auto bridge
iface bridge
      bridge-vlan-aware yes
      bridge-ports glob swp1-52
      bridge-stp on
      bridge-vids 310 700 707 712 850 910
